# SingleLine otf-svgMaker

`SingleLine otf-svgMaker` is a Python script for [Robofont](https://robofont.com/) by [Frederik Berlaen](https://typemytype.com/) that permits to export any skeletal / monoline UFO-based font project towards a single-line OpenType-SVG font with open paths running in the Adobe environment (CC 2019 and above) with kerning and opentype features full support. `SingleLine otf-svgMaker` uses [roundingPen](https://github.com/typemytype/outlinerRoboFontExtension/blob/master/Outliner.roboFontExt/lib/outlinePen.py) script by Frederik Berlaen. `SingleLine otf-svgMaker` script opens new perspectives for any typedesigner with monoline projects and fab labs users by largely simplifying typographical practices oriented towards CNC (Computer Numerical Control) engraving or printing.

This script was developed and first applied in the *Relief SingleLine* typeface distributed under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/ofl) and available for download at isdaT-type [Relief SingleLine Github repository](https://github.com/isdat-type/Relief-SingleLine). 

The resulting open paths OpenType-SVG fonts comprise two layers: a single-line layer based on SVG and a second layer with a classic outlined OTF. By default, if an application can’t use the open paths SVG layer it should switch automatically to the outlined OTF layer also embedded in this OpenType-SVG fonts.

In Illustrator or Indesign (CC 2019 and above), compose your typographic layout, then choose the function */Text /Vectorize* to achieve titles or paragraphs as single-line shapes to send to your favorite CNC machine or to print. With such open paths fonts you can apply for example an equal stroke thickness to your typographic composition no matter the type size.
